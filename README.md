# Sales-Prediction-Project

Preface: I challenged myself to do a machine learning task in order to put what i have learnt from school. This task involves using usign multiple data sources (including a dataset with at least **a MILLION rows of data**) in order to forecast and predict unit sales.

You’re a Data Scientist and a client from Ecuador has requested you to build a
predictive model that accurately forecasts product sales. They currently rely on subjective
forecasting methods with very little data to back them up and very little automation to execute
plans. They’re excited to see how machine learning could better ensure that they please
customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time. For this task, you are
expected to predict the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different client-owned stores
located in Ecuador. The training data in the sample dataset, provided by the client, includes
dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit
sales. The client has also provided you with additional files containing the details of the stores,
items, sales transactions, oil price and holiday events in Ecuador that might be helpful in
building the predictive model. The sample dataset can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/10MTLic3dYMfg6fiDuWt44kJ8kIBI9Fmd/view. Please refer
to the README file, attached within, for detailed information on the dataset. For evaluating your
model, consider the approach of splitting the given dataset into a training and a testing period.
You can use the testing period to evaluate the performance of your model.
